### :muscle: Learning goals:
- inferential statistics
- practice probabilities
- modelling data given the input

### :briefcase: Scenario:
We are an employee of a bank that operates in many countries around the world. The bank wants to target new potential customers, especially young people who are opening their first bank account. However, they want to target prospects who are most likely to have high incomes later in life. So the team you're working with has been tasked with creating a model to determine a person's income potential. Since we don't have a lot of datapoints, we must make do with a linear regression based on 3 variables:
- parents' income
- the average income of the country in which the prospect lives
- the Gini index calculated on the income of the inhabitants of the country in question

### :package: Dataset:
Our data comes from [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI), OpenClassrooms CSV files and various open sources that match our goals.

### :bar_chart: Results and conclusions:
